### Skydock - Automagic Service Discovery for [Docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/crosbymichael/skydock.png)](https://travis-ci.org/crosbymichael/skydock)


## NOTICE

Docker supports DNS based service discovery now.  You should use the Docker implementation instead of this project.
Skydock was built at a time when Docker did not support DNS discovery or auto registration.  I'll keep the repo
up for past years and as reference for others but don't use it if you have a recent version of Docker. 


Skydock monitors docker events when containers start, stop, die, kill, etc and inserts records into a dynamic
DNS server [skydns](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns1).  This allows standard DNS queries for services
running inside docker containers.  Because lets face it, if you have to modify your application code to work
with other service discovery solutions you might as well just give up.  DNS just works and it works well.  
Also you cannot be expected to modify application code that you don't own.  Passing service urls via the
cli or in static config files (nginx) will not be possible if your service discovery solution requires
a client library just to fetch an IP.  


[Skydns](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns1) is a very small and simple server that does DNS for 
discovery very well.  The authors and contributors to skydns helped a lot to make this project possible.
Skydns exposes a very simple REST API to add, update, and remove services.


#### The Details

When you start a container with docker an event is sent to skydock via the events endpoint.  Skydock will
then inspect the container's information and add an entry to skydns.  We setup skydns to bind it's nameserver
to the **docker0** bridge so that it is available to containers.  For DNS queries that are not part of the 
domain registered with skydns for service discovery, skydns will forward the query to an authoritative nameserver.
Skydns will return A, AAAA, and SRV records for registered services.



When designing skydock I made the assumption that when in the context of service discovery a client does
not care about a specific instance of a service running inside a container.  The client cares about the 
service and in the context of docker a service is defined by an image.  We have many images; redis, postgres,
our frontend applications, queues, and workers.  The URL scheme is designed using this assumption.


**Parts of the URL**
* Domain (domain name to resolve DNS requests for)
* Environment (context of what type of service is running dev, production, qa, uat)
* Service (the actual service name derived from the image name minus the repository crosbymichael/redis -> redis)
* Instance (container's name representing the actual instance of a service)
* Region (currently not used but will be your docker host, digitalocean, ec2; this will be used for multihost)


A typical query will look like this if your domain is `crosbymichael.com` and environment is `production`:

```bash
curl webapp.production.crosbymichael.com
```

The query above will return the IP for a container running the image webapp.  If we want a specific instance
we can prepend the container name to the query.  If our webapp container's name was webapp1 we could do this 
to get the specific container.

```bash
curl webapp1.webapp.production.crosbymichael.com
```

Very simple and easy and no client code was harmed in this demonstration.  Wildcard queries are also supported.  

```bash
dig @172.17.42.1 "webapp.*.crosbymichael.com"
```


#### Setup

So what type of hacks do you have to do to get this running?  Nothing, everything runs inside docker containers.
You are just two `docker run` s away from bliss.


Ok, I lied.  You have to make one change to your docker daemon.  You need to run the daemon with the `-dns` flag so
that docker injects a specific nameserver into the `/etc/resolv.conf` of each container that is run.  First get the 
IP address of the `docker0` bridge.  We will need to know the IP of the bridge so that we can tell skydns to bind it's 
nameserver to that IP.  For this example we will use the ip `172.17.42.1` as the `docker0` bridge.


```bash
# start your daemon with the -dns flag, figure it out...
docker -d --bip=172.17.42.1/16 --dns=172.17.42.1 # + what other settings you use
```

**Note:**
You can also pass the `-dns` flag to individual containers so that the DNS options only apply to specific 
containers and not everything started by the daemon.  But what fun is that?

Now we need to start skydns before our other containers are run or else they will not be able to resolve DNS queries.

```bash
docker pull crosbymichael/skydns
docker run -d -p 172.17.42.1:53:53/udp --name skydns crosbymichael/skydns -nameserver 8.8.8.8:53 -domain docker
```

We add the name skydns to the container and we use `-p` and tell docker to bind skydns port 53/udp to the docker0 bridge's IP.
We give skydns a nameserver of `8.8.8.8:53`.  This nameserver is used to forward queries that are not for service discovery to a 
real nameserver.  If you don't know `8.8.8.8` is google's public DNS address.


Next is the `-domain` flag.  This is the domain that you want skydns to resolve DNS queries for.  In this example I am running 
docker on my local development machine so I am using the domain name `docker`.  Any requests for services `*.docker` will be 
resolved by skydns for service discovery, all other requests will be forwarded to `8.8.8.8`.


Now that skydns is running we can start skydock to bridge the gap between docker and skydns.


```bash
docker pull crosbymichael/skydock
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock --name skydock crosbymichael/skydock -ttl 30 -environment dev -s /docker.sock -domain docker -name skydns
```


This one is as little more involved but the parts are still simple.  First we give it the name of skydock and we bind docker's unix socket into the container.
I'm guessing for most, you do not want to service the docker API on a tcp port for containers to reach.  If we bind the unix socket into this container we don't 
have to worry about other containers accessing the API, only skydock.  We also add a link for skydns so that skydock knows where to make requests to insert 
new records.  We are pre DNS discovery at this point.


Now we have a few settings to assign to skydock.  First is the TTL value that you want all services to have when skydock adds them to DNS.  I'm using a
TTL value 30 seconds but you can set it higher or lower if needed.  Skydock will also start a heartbeat for the service after it is added.  You can use 
the `-beat` flag to set this default interval in seconds for the heartbeat or skydock will set the heartbeat interval to `TTL -(TTL/4)`.  I know, too 
complicated.


Next is the `-environment` flag which is the second part of your DNS queries.  I set this to `dev` because it is running on my local machine.  `-s` is 
the final option and it just tells skydock where to find docker's unix socket so that it can make requests to docker's API.


Now you're done.  Just start containers and use intuitive urls to discover your services.  Here is an small example starting a redis server and connecting 
the redis-cli to that instance of the service.  Because it's DNS you can specific the urls on `docker run`.  


```bash
# run an instance of redis
docker run -d --name redis1 crosbymichael/redis
03582c0de0ebb10665678d6ed530ae98bebd7d63dad5e7fb1cd53ffb1f85d91d

# run the cli and connect to our new instance
docker run -t -i crosbymichael/redis-cli -h redis1.redis.dev.docker

redis.dev.docker:6379> set name koye
OK
redis.dev.docker:6379> get name
"koye"
redis.dev.docker:6379>

```

That is, the `redis1` named `crosbymichael/redis` container was available under the hostname `redis1.redis.dev.docker`.

```
dig @172.17.42.1 +short redis1.redis.dev.docker
172.17.0.4
```

If you were to run additional `crosbymichael/redis` containers, they would all be available under the `redis.dev.docker` hostname.

```
docker run -d --name redis2 crosbymichael/redis
docker run -d --name redis3 crosbymichael/redis

dig @172.17.42.1 +short redis.dev.docker
172.17.0.4
172.17.0.5
172.17.0.6
```

#### Plugin support
I just added plugin support via [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto) to allow users to write plugins in javascript.  Currently only one function uses plugins and that is `createService(container)`.  This function takes a container's configuration and converts it into a DNS service  The current functionality is implementing in this javascript function:

```javascript
function createService(container) {
    return {
        Port: 80,
        Environment: defaultEnvironment,
        TTL: defaultTTL,
        Service: cleanImageName(container.Image),
        Instance: removeSlash(container.Name),
        Host: container.NetworkSettings.IpAddress
    }; 
}
```

Your function must be called `createservice` which takes one object, the container, and must return a service with the fields shown above.  In your plugin you have access to the following global variables and functions.


```javascript
var defaultEnvironment = "string - the environment from the -environment flag";
var defaultTTL = 30; // int - the ttl value from the -ttl flag

function cleanImageName(string) string // cleans the repo and tags of the passed parameter returning the result
function removeSlash(string) string  // removes all / from the passed parameter returning the result
```

And that is it.  Just add a `createservice` function to a .js file then use the `-plugins` flag to enable your new plugin.  Plugins are loaded at start so changes made to the functions during the life of skydock are not reflected, you have to restart ( done for performance ).  

```bash
docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/docker.sock -v /myplugins.js:/myplugins.js --name skydock --link skydns:skydns crosbymichael/skydock -s /docker.sock -domain docker -plugins /myplugins.js
```

Feel free to submit your plugins to this repo under the `plugins/` directory.
