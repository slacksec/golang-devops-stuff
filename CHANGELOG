0.4.0
= Security:
- Requires server support TLS 1.0 or higher (#402). This resolves a number of
  security concerns, including POODLE. The POODLE concern was reported
  and validated by Tray Torrance, Marc Chadwick, and David Arena. Additionally,
  the PCI SSC announced that SSLv3 was not acceptable anymore.

= General:
- Tested succsesfully against Logstash 1.4.2 and Logstash 1.5.
- rpm and deb packaging supported with init scripts
- Comments '#' are supported in the config file now! (#154, Michael Pearson)
- The argument to -config can be a directory. If so, all files in that directory
  are loaded and merged into a single config. (#154, Michael Pearson)
- Add -quiet flag to omit any notification/informational log messages from lsf.
- Open files are now closed after they are idle for some time period. This
  time period is called "dead time" and it is configurable per file section.
