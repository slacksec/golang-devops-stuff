		A failover request has been submitted to the constellation. It will take a few
		seconds to determine if the request was successful. In {{.RefreshTime}} seconds
		the Pod's view will automatically be reloaded.
	</p>
	<p> In the meantime you can load a different page without interrupting the failover process.
