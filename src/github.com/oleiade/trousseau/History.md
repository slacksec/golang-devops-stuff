==================

!! Backward Incompatibility !!

Trousseau data store file format changed, and trousseau >= 0.3.1 are 
now incompatible with older version created files.

Fortunately, trousseau now exposes a 'upgrade' command which will take
care to upgrade your existing data stores.

So if you are upgrading from former versions, please, upgrade.
