# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/oleiade/trousseau/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* The trousseau release you're using, or the git commit you've compiled it from.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to fix it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
or "feature" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Trousseau could always use more documentation, whether as part of the 
official trousseau docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in presentations,
blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/oleiade/trousseau/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain what's the need you're trying to tackle, the problem you're trying to fix, the frustration you're trying to avoid.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, it will make it easier to define the implementation.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `trousseau` for local development.

* Fork the `trousseau` repo on GitHub.
* Clone your fork locally:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/trousseau.git
```
* Start a branch from ``develop`` dedicated to your changes
```bash
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```
Start commiting your changes in your branch.
* When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass tests, and are properly formatted:
```bash
$ make test
$ make format
```
* Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```
* Submit a pull request to the develop branch through the GitHub website.
