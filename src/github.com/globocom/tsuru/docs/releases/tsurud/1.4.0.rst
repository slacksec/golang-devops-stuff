tsurud 1.4.0 release notes
==========================

Welcome to tsurud 1.4.0!

These release notes cover the :ref:`new features <new-1.4.0>`, :ref:`bug fixes
<bug-1.4.0>`.

.. _new-1.4.0:

New features
============

Generic API based Router (`#1572 <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru/issues/1572>`_)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The support for a new router type, named `api`, was introduced in this release.
This type of router resembles the service concept, in which it is an agnostic
API that must follow a specific contract. This API will be called on every router
operation, e.g, adding and removing new routes.
