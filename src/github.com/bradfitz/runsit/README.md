# runsit

runsit was my daemon control system before I switched to systemd. Do not use runsit.

# Should I use runsit?

No. Do not use this. It's old.

# How do I run runsit?

Don't.

# What should I use instead?

systemd does more, and better.

# But I'm not on Linux.

runsit wasn't really tested on things other than Linux anyway.

# Why don't you just delete this repo?

For archaeological reasons.
